## Description:
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). This ORM-E-Commerce is the back end for an e-commerce site. There's a plethora amount of things happening within the scripts that takes a bit to understand, thankfully after spending time on this I am definitely leaving with a better understanding more how CRUD methods work and with a better understanding of RESTful CRUD Operations.
